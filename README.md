# Text-Editor-PWA

## Description

This project is a progressive web application (PWA) of a simple text editor. This project utilizes [workbox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/workbox-webpack-plugin) for handling service workers, [webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) for bundling code for optimization, [IndexedDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/idb) for handling data, and [babel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babel/core) for backward compatibility. This project allowed me to practice the process of turning a regular web app into a PWA with the use of previously mentioned npm libraries.
